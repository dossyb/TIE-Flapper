# TIE-Flapper
A Star Wars-themed Flappy Bird clone written in C++ using the Splashkit library.

Game is currently in a mostly-finished state with physics, collision, menus, and score-keeping. I may extend and improve on this project in the future, but for now I have achievd everything within the original scope and am happy with the finished product. Some small tweaks may be made here and there going forward.

This version of the game has procedurally generated asteroids as a visual distraction in preparation for submission as a uni project - the assessment requires the use of an array/vector which the base version of the game did not utilise.
