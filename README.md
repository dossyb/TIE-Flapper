# TIE-Flapper
A Star Wars-themed Flappy Bird clone written in C++ using the Splashkit library.

Game is currently in a mostly-finished state with physics, collision, menus, and score-keeping. I may extend and improve on this project in the future, but for now I have achievd everything within the original scope and am happy with the finished product. Some small tweaks may be made here and there going forward.

* Add randomly-generated space junk in background to satisfy "array" requirement
